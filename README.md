# Do Compiler
The Do Programming Language Compiler üí°üßê

In the project's directory you can find the `do.exe` executable, the Do Programming Language Compiler for Windows!

### Setup
To make the do compiler globally available, add the path to the folder the `do.exe` file is located in to the PATH environment variable

### Compile .do
Here is how to compile your do code using the do compiler:
- Run `do /path/to/source.do /path/to/destination.asm` in the command line to compile your do code into x64 MASM assembly code
    - Run `do` without any arguments to see how to use the command
- After you've ran the `do` command properly with your `.do` file, you should get the compiled `.asm` file which contains the x64 MASM assembly code representation of your do program

### Compile .asm
Here is how to compile the x64 MASM assembly code that is generated by the do compiler:
- Add the path to the `masm64` directory to your PATH environment variable, it contains all the files needed to compile the x64 MASM assembly code
- Run `ml64 filename.asm /link /subsystem:windows /entry:main` in the command line to compile the `.asm` file to `.exe` executable

### Build
If you've accidentally deleted the `do.exe` file, you can easily rebuild it by running `build.bat` in the project's directory

### Example
The `exmaple.do` file contains an example do code. Run `do example.do example.asm` in the cmd to see an example output
