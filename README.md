# Do Compiler
The Do Programming Language Compiler üí°üßê

In the project's directory you can find the `do.exe` executable, the Do Language Compiler for Windows!

### Setup
To make the Do Language Compiler globally available, add the path to the folder the `do.exe` file is located in to the PATH environment variable

### Compile .do
Here is how to compile your do code using the Do Language Compiler:
- Run `do /path/to/your/source_file.do /path/to/your/destination_file.asm` in the command line to compile your do code into x64 MASM assembly code
    - Run `do` in the cmd without any arguments to see how to use the command
- After you've ran the `do` command properly with your `.do` file, you should get the compiled `.asm` file which contains the x64 MASM assembly code representation of your do program

### Compile .asm
Here is how to compile the x64 MASM assembly code that is generated by the Do Language Compiler:
- Add the path to the `masm64` directory to your PATH environment variable, it contains all the files needed to compile the x64 assembly code that is generated by the Do Language Compiler
- Run `ml64 filename.asm /link /subsystem:windows /entry:main` to compile the `.asm` file to `.exe` executable

### Build
Here is how to get the `do.exe` executable if you've accidentaly deleted it:
- Run `build.bat` in the project's directory to get the `do.exe` file, the Do Language Compiler for Windows!

### Example
The `exmaple.do` file contains an example do code, run `do example.do example.asm` in the cmd to see an example output
